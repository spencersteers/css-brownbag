### Summary

Identify the issue:
- Is the width of my element not what I think it should be?
- Is the element falling off the page?

With the issue in mind we can begin to find the problem element
- Start with element that is out of place
- If everything looks right then locate the parent
- The parent will often be the element where the highlight position jumps to contain the element

Things to lookout for when aligning alignment issues occur
- `height` / `width` is a percentage not set to 100%
- Percentage values can be fine but only when the remaining percentage is used somewhere obvious

### Summary

The size of your elements content is the hardest thing to predict
- The parent element establishes a context for your child elements
- Block elements fill the width of their parent and grow in height to contain their children
- Inline elements have height defined by `line-height`

Position impacts how your content flows
- Limit position to small scopes: Nearby ancestors set to `position: relative`
